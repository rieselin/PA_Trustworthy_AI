\section{Plan Methodik:}


e.g. heatmap shows which pixels activated the neurons the most
but how did these activations result in the decision that this is a dog?


called: saliency verbalization \cite{feldhus_saliency_2023}, \cite{chen_explainable_nodate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain YOLO output with LIME/SHAP
    \item Explain that output with LLAMA
    \item Analyze how different groups of people interpret that in regards to trust
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Limitations / Problems}
Limits: It’s still post-hoc interpretation: the VLM is interpreting the attribution artifact, not actually reading the internals of the target model. The VLM can hallucinate plausible reasons (=> structured inputs, verification steps, faithfulness tests)


Use SHAP cause is less human - interpretable
